# Angular2-Webpack
Angular2 RC6 with Webpack

This is a very simple Angular2 app that makes use of Http, Routing, Reactive Forms & Webpack.

Use bower to install, `bower install bootstrap` and `bower install font-awesome`

Then npm to install, `npm install`, `npm start/npm build`

I will keep this repo up-to-date with angular2 latest updates.
